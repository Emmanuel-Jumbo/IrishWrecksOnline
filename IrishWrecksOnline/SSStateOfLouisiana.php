    In three sections, but starting to deteriorate.<br>
    The bow and bridge sections lie on the South side of Hunter's Rock, the stern to the North.<br>
    The bow is intact on its port side at 24m, the bridge section is 15m astern of the bow some 15m off the rock, the stern section lies in 25m at the base of the rock.<br>
    Still a few artifacts to be found, e.g. old lemonade bottles, and she teems with sea life.<br>
    Advisable to moor boat on site and await slack water.<br>
    Dive 1 hour before Larne low or high water. Slack is only 45 mins.

				<h2>Historical Information</h2><br>
				<p>
    A 3 Masted iron vessel and built by Windgate on the Clyde in 1872, she weighed over 1216 net tons, and measured 300 x 35 x 24ft and had 2 decks.<br>
    She was owned by Merrow & Co. who used her for shipping emigrants to America.<br>
    On a trip from Glasgow to Larne/New York, she ran aground on Hunters Rock and was badly holed. The buoy marking the rock had been dislodged.<br>
    Two tugs from Belfast and two from the Clyde could do little except take off the crew and the seventeen passengers, and some of the 2000 tons of cargo.<br>
    Commanded by Captain McGowan.<br>
    On January 13th, 1879, the big steamer cracked into three parts and sank.<br>
    She was discovered by a local diving club in 1966.

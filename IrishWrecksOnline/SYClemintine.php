    Mainly broken sections, the largest being the boiler.<br>
    A large proportion was salvaged, and what is left is well embedded in the sandy bottom.<br>
    Should be dived on an incoming tide as the slip is left high and dry at Low Water.<br>
    Use 65 degrees x 500yds from Church.

    She is thought to be a former the Belgian Royal Yacht.<br>
    She foundered on rocks at Red Bay, when in service for the Royal Navy. Much of it was salvaged by Murray Bros. of Waterfoot.<br>
    One of the Murray Brothers was attacked by a conger, estimated at over 20ft. long. He is said to have never dived again as a result.<br>
    The main shaft was sold to the lime works in Glenarm.</p><br>

    <h2>Post Script</h2>>
    <p>Recent research suggest her name was acually "S.Y. Clementina", built in 1887, grossing 625 tons and was converted to an armed auxilary at some point. Although only a difference of one character ("a" as opposed to "e") it could prove to be a totally different vessel.<br>
    The photo above is the "S.Y. Clementina" (ex-Sultana, ex-Rondine).

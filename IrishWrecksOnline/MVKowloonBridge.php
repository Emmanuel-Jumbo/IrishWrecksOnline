				<h2>Historical Information</h2><br>
				<p>
    Built by Swan Hunter, Haverton Hill, in the 1970’s, she grossed 89,438 tons and measuered 294.13 x 44.19 x 25.01 metres.<br>
    Is the largest wreck in Europe.<br>
    Was carrying 165,000 tons of iron ore and 2,000 tons of oil from Seven Islands, Quebec for the River Clyde.<br>
    Ran aground on the Stagg Rocks during a gale after losing steerage.<br>
    She had previously sheltered for a few days in Bantry Bay to repair cracks in her decks before venturing out.<br>
    The 28 crew were air-lifted off by the RAF, and her engines were left running in reverse to try and dislodge her.<br>
    The Dutch tug "Smit Rotterdam" failed to tow her off.<br>
    The following Spring she broke in three and sank.<br>
    The vessel was worth £8.4m. and the cargo £2.7m.<br>
    Her 1,200 tons of bunker fuel caused serious pollution in the area.
